# Doing Data Science Craft Beer Case Study  

The case study includes the following topics   
  a. Number of breweries across each State  
  b. How are we handling the Missing values and duplicates in the datasets  
  c. Some stats on ABV and IBU variables and their relationship  
  d. Recommendation for new beer  

## KNN Model  
We created a variable called Beer Type("Typ") which holds three values('IPA', 'Other Ales', 'Other Beers').
As part of implementing a KNN model to predict beer types('IPA' and 'Other Ales'), the variables ABV and IBU are used.
Looking at the results of our model it seems to be doing a great job classifying the IPAs vs. Other Ales with an accuracy of ~ 90%, sensitivity ~ 89.5% and specificity ~ 91% with a K value of 5.
